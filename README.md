# Overview
**ReflectionUI** is a free (open source) Java GUI builder/generator library.

The generation of the GUI (graphical user interface) requires no other information that the object itself. Its structure is discovered at run-time through Java reflection.The generated GUI can be customized in a non-intrusive way by overriding some key methods of the generator objects.

**CustomUI** is a sub-project of ReflectionUI providing a GUI builder. It actually allows WYSIWYG advanced customizations of user interfaces generated by ReflectionUI.
